## Release meetings

As part of completing documentation for a release, Information Development writers must attend additional squad and feature-specific meetings:

- Design meetings

  As part of completing UI (management console) changes during a release, Information Development writers must work with the design team to review and assist with any textual changes to ensure that the PII meets IBM design and content standards. To go over planned and in progress UI changes, ID writers should attend initial planning and design reviews with designers and development to go over requirements and prototypes. In addition, ID writers should attend any demos or playbacks that are related to the UI changes.

  If you are an ID writer, ensure that you contact the design lead for each squad that you work with to ensure that you attend any required design meetings, demos, and playbacks.

- Development scrums and meetings

  As part of working with a development squad, Information Development writers must work closely with development. Writers should attend development scrums when possible to remain up to date on the release status, and to remain informed about know issues, and to maintain communication.

  If you are a writer, contact your development squad lead to ensure that you are invited to all development scrums and meetings, such as planning and review meetings.

- Leads call

  All squad and team leads meet regularly to report on the status for each squad that they cover. For the Information Development team, the team lead reports on the high-level status of the team, including any blockers that require help from other squads, as well as reminders of upcoming deadlines that impact the broader development team (translation cutoffs).
