## Support training

As part of each release, the Information Development team is responsible for helping with editing training modules for IBM Support and IBM Services. This training is typically composed of slide decks and other supporting written material. The initial drafts for this material are provided by development. The Information development team assists with supporting product documentation and editing.

## Client feedback and questions

To provide feedback or questions regarding documentation, clients and other external users can contact IBM Support or post a comment through the Disqus commenting feature on IBM Knowledge Center.

When a comment is posted, an automated email is sent to all writers that are subscribed to the product IBM Knowledge Center where the comment was posted.

As an Information Development writer, when a comment is posted complete the following tasks:

1. Investigate the comment to determine whether the comment is valid and to identify the solution. If required, contact development, such as by posting on internal Slack channels, to obtain help.
2. If the comment is valid, open an Issue in GitHub for addressing the issue and tracking purposes. Include `[Disqus]` in the issue title.
3. After completing any required updates or answering the question, respond to the user through the Disqus commenting feature.
4. Contact the KC team (See team focals) to get the KC Comment deleted when the change is included in the documentation or product. You can also have the comment deleted if the comment is not valid or appropriate or if no change is needed.

**Important:** If the user is an internal IBM employee, remind the user that the Disqus commenting feature is for client-use only. IBM employee originated issues should always be created as GitHub issues.

## Sample responses for client feedback

### Out of our scope

Thanks for your comment! That’s out of the scope of this topic. You might want to ask for help on the [IBM Cloud Private Slack](http://ibm.biz/BdsHmN).

### Internal users offering legitimate Disqus comments

Thank you for bringing this to our attention! We will create an issue in GitHub for the updates. In the future, if you are an internal user (IBM employee), please open a Git Enterprise issue (https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/roadmap/issues/new/choose) in IBMPrivateCloud for discrepancies like this one. Internal discussions about the product also take place on Slack at #private-cloud (internal channel).

### External users offering legitimate Disqus comments

Thank you for bringing this to our attention! We will create an issue in GitHub for the updates. In the future, for technical support while working with IBM Cloud Private, please checkout one of the support platforms here: http://ibm.biz/BdsHmN. 

Please take a look at the latest documentation to see if you can get more guidance. If that does not help, see the following link to get your question or comment addressed.

## Software lifecycle announcements

When an offering is on the path to being discontinued, IBM formally announces the dates when the offering will no longer be available for purchase and no longer supported. For examples of these announcements, including the announcements for IBM Cloud Private, see:
