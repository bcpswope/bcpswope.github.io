## Editors

One team member serves as the Medium owner and manages the process to get blogs published. The owner also can work closely as a developer advocate, ensuring that developers know how to blog on IBM blogs, as well as Medium.

All ID team members create an account from https://medium.com/ibm-cloud and serve as technical editors/developer advocates for their squads.

See the [Blogging Strategy](blogging_strategy.md) before you read this.

See the following Medium permissions to understand roles: https://medium.com/ibm-cloud/settings

- The owner can admin editors/writers.
- The entire ID team has editor access, can assign writers, and can change/publish content.
- Editors cannot assign other editors.
- For all blogs, the developer opens an issue for ID with a link to their blog submission (or other draft locations) and labels it `blog` and `squad doc`.
- If your developers want to contribute to Medium, have them follow the process. As an editor, you can _invite_ your developer. Other blog options are listed in the directions.
- The author (developer) can modify within their own public account, but must submit to our publication to get the change in IBM Cloud Medium.
- ID edits blogs from our developers. Others teams can contribute, but must have an editor assigned to the GitHub issue. Blogs that are not checked by an editor cannot be released in Medium.
- All editors receive emails for incoming drafts and are also notified in Medium on the bell icon.
- The Medium focal or back-up focal may need to assign them according to component area.
- There is no need to take action on those email notifications unless you are assigned editor for that blog, or unless owner is absent.
- You should see an Edit link for a blog was submitted for review/publishing.
- If you don't see this link, the author either retracted the submission or published it under his/her own medium account. In this scenario, you can close the issue if one was opened.
- After you complete the review/edits to the blog, give the author time to accept into his/her public draft and resubmit. You can then click `Publish`.
- If you want the author to review your edits before you publish, you can also tag them in the issue and provide the edits; then add them after you discuss them.
- Remember that there are two versions, theirs and IBM Cloud's

## Dos and Don'ts

1. Have fun! With blogs, you as the editor can help organize and be a bit more creative than with product doc. 
2. Relax! Use looser language and writing style, but don't get crazy!
3. You also can blog and you can co-write with your devs!
4. Try to refrain from using "we" on Medium because it makes a claim about IBM.
5. Remember that Medium is third-party and can go away anytime, be protective of valuable tasks and such. Always recommend IBM blogs first.
6. Don't let them use abbreviations. If you Google ROKS, you will see why! Too many options when we use abbreviations--unless they are approved.
