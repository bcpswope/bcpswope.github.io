The following section details the architectural structure of the product documentation. This documentation includes the Knowledge Center, Blogs, and IBM Cloud Docs.

## Documentation types and uses

### Knowledge Center vs IBM Cloud Docs vs Blogs

- All Knowledge Center documentation is supported by IBM and maintained by the Information Development team.

- Blogs that are hosted on IBM sites or classified as from IBM are representations of IBM and are edited by the Information Development team. The maintenance of the blog content is the responsibility of the Blog writer to maintain. The content within blogs is not supported by IBM.

- Content that is included with GitHub repositories might not be classified as official product documentation and might not be covered by IBM Support or the Information Development team. Before including product documentation for external release in GitHub repositories, ensure that a plan and procedure is in place for maintaining the documentation.  

- In general, any documentation that is required by clients to setup and use IBM products should be in an officially supported set of documentation. This documentation should always be the responsibility of development, IBM Support, or the Information Development team to maintain.
